crash when no root (on N?) Logcat would be helpful!
when you update supersu, parrotmod does not work and says there is no root until you reboot

"HELP! MY TOUCHSCREEN HAS STOPPED WORKING AFTER I INSTALLED THIS! YOU SUCK!!!one!1!!1eleven!!!1"
---------------------------------

Apparently, there is a VERY RARE incompatibility with some touchscreen firmwares which requires you to reset the firmware before installing ParrotMod. ONLY do this if your touchscreen stops working after installing it.

(You need fastboot & adb on your computer, Google it)

1) Plug the tablet into the computer
2) Turn on the tablet with power & volume down buttons pressed, to enter the bootloader
3) download the boot-ts.7z from [url]http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2428133[/url] and extract it to a folder, open command prompt/Terminal, cd to that folder
4) run: fastboot boot boot-ts10-lock.img
5) your device will bootloop. just run "adb reboot bootloader" after about 30 seconds to get back to bootloader
4) run: fastboot boot boot-ts-unlock.img
5) your device will bootloop. just run "adb reboot" after about 30 seconds and Android should boot up with touch working
